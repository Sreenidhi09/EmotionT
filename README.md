Part I – Software Requirement Specification (SRS) \[10 Marks]

1. Purpose / Abstract:
   Question: Write a detailed purpose and abstract for an Online Food Ordering System (OFOS) that explains why the system is needed, what problems it solves, and the benefits to customers and restaurant staff.
   Answer: The purpose of the Online Food Ordering System (OFOS) is to automate and streamline the process of browsing menus, placing food orders, making payments, and tracking deliveries in a restaurant environment. It addresses common problems like manual order errors, delayed deliveries, lack of payment options, and inefficient order management. The system benefits customers by providing convenience, faster ordering, multiple payment options, and real-time order status updates. For restaurant staff, it simplifies order handling, reduces errors, and improves delivery management.

2. Functional Requirements:
   Question: List and explain the key functional features the OFOS should include to solve common restaurant and customer problems.
   Answer:

* Menu browsing: Customers can view detailed menu items with images, descriptions, and prices.
* Food ordering: Users can add items to a cart, modify quantities, and place orders.
* Online payments: Secure integration with payment gateways for credit/debit cards and wallets.
* Order status tracking: Real-time updates on order preparation, dispatch, and delivery.
* User account management: Profile management, order history, and favorite items.

3. Non-Functional Requirements:
   Question: Describe how the system should behave in terms of performance, security, usability, scalability, and availability.
   Answer:

* Usability: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for all users.
* Performance: Fast response times even with hundreds of concurrent users.
* Security: Secure login, encrypted payments, role-based access for staff and admins.
* Scalability: Capable of handling increasing number of users and orders.
* Availability: High uptime to ensure system accessibility 24/7.

4. Users and Interaction:
   Question: Identify all types of users and explain their interaction with the system.
   Answer:

* Customer: Browses menu, places orders, makes payments, and tracks delivery.
* Restaurant Staff: Updates menu items, manages incoming orders, and tracks delivery.
* Admin: Oversees system configuration, user management, and monitors performance.

5. Modules:
   Question: Break the OFOS into logical modules and explain each module's function.
   Answer:

* Menu Module: Handles creation, update, and display of menu items.
* Order Module: Manages order placement, cart functionality, and order tracking.
* Payment Module: Processes payments securely through integrated gateways.
* Delivery Tracking Module: Monitors the status and location of orders.
* User Management Module: Manages customer and staff accounts and permissions.
